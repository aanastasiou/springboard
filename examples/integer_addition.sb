# Symbol substitutions to implement addition between two numbers 
# stored in two successive cells.
#
# Notice here:
#    - The symbol "0" is defined as [-], which ensures that a cell is zero.
#    - Similarly "1" is defined as "symbol 0" followed by +.
#    - Symbols "0" and "1" are NOT numbers. If you try to load 2>1 to 
#      the memory you will get an error. To use 2, you need to define it.

: 0 [-];
: 1 0+;
: add [-<+>];
