# Springboard "Libraries"

The files in this directory contain pre-defined symbols that might be useful in structuring 
bigger programs. These are as follows:

* `num_base_N.sb`
  * Integers, defined recursively starting from 0 as `[0]` and proceeding with 1 as `0 +`, 2 as `1 +` and so on.

* `stack.sb`
  * Functions that enable a stack based programming style in brainfuck (`pop, push, swap, dup` etc)
  
* `math.sb`
  * Mathematical functions such as `add, mul, sub` and so on. All of them operate over two adjacent memory cells.

* `str.sb`
  * (Very) basic string functions.
  
* `bool.sb`
  * Definitions of elementary logic functions (`and, not, or`)
